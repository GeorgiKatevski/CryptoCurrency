# Wallet Management System

## Overview

The Wallet Management System is designed to manage cryptocurrency portfolios, transactions, and trade orders. This system supports wallet creation, transaction processing, order management, and reporting. It also interacts with binary files for persistent storage.

  - **Behavior**:
    - Generate a unique wallet ID (a positive integer less than \(2^{32}\)).
    - Store wallet details in `wallets.dat` (binary file).
    - On creation, the wallet is credited with FMICoins equal to `fiatMoney / 375`.
    - Record a transaction from the system wallet (ID 4294967295) to the new wallet with the calculated FMICoins.

### 2. Transaction Management

    - `fmiCoins`: Amount of FMICoins to transfer.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Ensure both wallets exist and the sender has enough FMICoins.
    - Record the transaction in `transactions.dat` (binary file).

### 3. Order Management

- **Command**: `make-order type fmiCoins walletId`
  - **Description**: Creates a buy or sell order for FMICoins.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `type`: Type of the order (`SELL` or `BUY`).

    - For a sell order, match with existing buy orders and adjust balances accordingly.
    - For a buy order, match with existing sell orders and adjust balances accordingly.
    - Record all orders in `orders.dat` (binary file).
    - Generate a text file reporting executed orders.

### 4. Wallet Information

- **Command**: `wallet-info walletId`
  - **Description**: Provides detailed information about a wallet.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `walletId`: ID of the wallet.

### 6. Application Termination

- **Command**: `quit`
  - **Description**: Exits the application and ensures all data is saved to the respective files.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Save current data in `wallets.dat`, `transactions.dat`, and `orders.dat`.

## Data Structures

- **Wallet**:
  ```cpp
  struct Wallet {
      char owner[256];
      unsigned id;
      double fiatMoney;
  };
  struct Transaction {
    long long time;
    unsigned senderId;
    unsigned receiverId;
    double fmiCoins;
  };
  struct Order {
    enum Type { SELL, BUY } type;
    unsigned walletId;
    double fmiCoins;
  };
